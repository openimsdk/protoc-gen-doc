### Any

| Field | Type | Label | Description |
| ----- | ---- | ----- | ----------- |
| type_url | [string](docs/scalar/scalar.mdx) |  | A URL/resource name that uniquely identifies the type of the serialized<br>protocol buffer message. This string must contain at least<br>one "/" character. The last segment of the URL's path must represent<br>the fully qualified name of the type (as in<br>`path/google.protobuf.Duration`). The name should be in a canonical form<br>(e.g., leading "." is not accepted).<br><br>In practice, teams usually precompile into the binary all types that they<br>expect it to use in the context of Any. However, for URLs which use the<br>scheme `http`, `https`, or no scheme, one can optionally set up a type<br>server that maps type URLs to message definitions as follows:<br><br>* If no scheme is provided, `https` is assumed.<br>* An HTTP GET on the URL must yield a [google.protobuf.Type][]<br>  value in binary format, or produce an error.<br>* Applications are allowed to cache lookup results based on the<br>  URL, or have them precompiled into a binary to avoid any<br>  lookup. Therefore, binary compatibility needs to be preserved<br>  on changes to types. (Use versioned type names to manage<br>  breaking changes.)<br><br>Note: this functionality is not currently available in the official<br>protobuf release, and it is not used for type URLs beginning with<br>type.googleapis.com. As of May 2023, there are no widely used type server<br>implementations and no plans to implement one.<br><br>Schemes other than `http`, `https` (or the empty scheme) might be<br>used with implementation specific semantics. |
| value | [bytes](docs/scalar/scalar.mdx) |  | Must be a valid serialized protocol buffer of the above specified type. |
